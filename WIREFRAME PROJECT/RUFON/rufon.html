                <h2>Short story of Myself</h2>
            <blockquote><p>Hello! I`m Joart Virtudazo Rufon and I am currently studying at <strong>Technological University of the Philippines-Manila</strong> with the program <br>of <em> Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering</em></bold>. I am the oldest child of Annie and Mariano Rufon. Growing up my life has a lot of difficulties, but I cannot tell because it is personal. I was born and raised in the province of Agusan Del Sur, specifically in the town of Prosperidad in Mindanao. My favourite fruit is<i> Durian </i>where every year the durian tree in our backyard always has fruit. When I was a kid, I used to play<em> kariling</em>. This game only requires an old bicycle tire, I play it with my childhood friends in my province. I came up to study here in Metro-Manila when I was 14 years old when my auntie brings me here in this Industrious City to support my family education, I was grade 8 that time and it is hard for me to speak tagalog because in my whole life I only speak bisaya. Back then, I am a cool person that do not usually interact to my classmates but day by day as my surroundings talk tagalog I able to speak tagalog as well. I graduated from my junior high school and senior high school in Navotas National High School where in junior high school I received with honor and in senior high I received with high honor. After I graduated in senior high, I interested to become a soldier and enter in Philippine Military Academy unfortunately I did not pass the entrance exam. So that my second choice to be an engineer led me here. </p></blockquote>
